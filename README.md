# PowHERful Builds a Chatbot with Watson Assistant

This activity will walk you through creating your first chatbot. Instead of a traditional form or wizard, this chatbot can offer a more personalized experience, working with you towards a common goal.

In IBM Cloud there are often multiple ways to accomplish the same steps. In the steps outlined below, you should consider this one way to accomplish a given task.

## Login to IBM Cloud

Navigate to the IBM Cloud dashboard: cloud.ibm.com

Using the username and password provided, type the username in the box.

![IBM Cloud login page][login]

Click ```Continue```.

Once you successfully login you should see the IBM Cloud Dashboard.


## Create an instance of the Watson Assistant service

Click ```Catalog``` in the upper menu bar.

![IBM Cloud Dashboard with an annotation pointing to Catalog.][dashboardCatalog]

This will load a full list of all available services in the Catalog. Click ```AI```.

![Catalog in IBM Cloud with an annotation pointing to the AI category.][catalogAI]

You should see all the AI services in IBM Cloud, including the Watson API Services and data science tools and platforms. Click ```Watson Assistant```.

![AI services in IBM Cloud with an annotation pointing to the Watson Assistant service.][AIassistant]

This starts the process of creating your Watson Assistant service. Make sure you give your service a good, descriptive name - ```PowHERful 2019``` or just keep the autogenerated one. 

You can leave all the remaining fields with the defaults, including the Pricing Plan. Click ```Create```.

![Provisioning screen of Watson Assistant.][createScreen]

Depending on the wifi signal strength and connection, this next step may spin for a bit as your Watson Assistant service is being created. When the screen loads, notice your API key and URL. You'll need this information if you decide to deploy your bot after the lab. Click ```Launch tool```.

![Watson Assistant service screen with annotation for Launch tool button.][launchTool]

You are now ready to start building your bot!

## Create a Skill

Your Watson Assistant instance should load and take you to a page where you can see information about the steps to build your assistants. Click ```Create a Skill``` to start building.

![Watson Assistant Home screen with an annotation for the Create a skill button.][createSkillButton]

If you had skills already created, you would see them below. Click ```Create new```.

![Watson Assistant Skills page with an annotation for the Create new button.][createNewSkill]

Name your skill something useful - ```Order Pizza```. If you or your users speak a language other than English, take note of the available options in the language dropdown.

![Add Dialog Skill screen with form to create new skill.][addDialogSkill]

Your skill should look something like this. Click ```Create```.

![Add Dialog Skill screen with information in form to create new skill with annotation pointing to Create button.][skillFilled]

## Build Intents

Once you've created a skill, you can add your intents. An intent is a goal or purpose of the user's input. Think about how you, your friends, and family may order a pizza.

Click ```Add intent```.

![Initial Intents screen with definition of Intents and annotation pointing to Add intent.][addIntent]

Notice the ```Intent name``` field a hash/hashtag or # sign in front of it. 

Name your intent ```order``` as this is the best way to describe the user's goal. If you want a pizza, you have to order it first!

![Blank create new intent screen with no user examples.][createNewIntent]

Provide user examples and hit Enter to see them appear in the list below. Think through how you might prompt someone in a conversation to indicate to them that you need to order a pizza. Maybe "Are you hungry" or "I want to order a pizza" or something similar. 

When finished, hit the back arrow next to the intent name at the top.

![Create intent screen with a name and user examples per the lab.][userExamplesIntent]

You now see your intent listed below. Let's move on to entities.

## Build Entities

With the intent you just created, we now know the user is looking to order a pizza. Simply saying you want to order a pizza will not be enough, we need more information.

Click ```Entities```.

![Intents screen with one intent and an annotation pointing to the Entities tab.][entities]

We need to build an entity. An entity is a portion of the user's input that you can use to provide a different response to a particular intent. Basically its a set of things.

For example, we need a way to specify what kinds of toppings the pizza may have so our user can build their pizza. Let's create an entity to handle that.

Click ```Add entity```.

![Initial my entities screen with annotation for the Add entity button.][addEntity]

Notice the ```Entity name``` field has an at-symbol or @ sign in front of it. 

Name your entity ```toppings```.

![Blank create new entity screen with no values.][createNewEntity]

Let's provide 3 values for entities - ```pepperoni```, ```veggie```, and ```garlic```. If you can think of synonyms feel free to provide those as well. 

Click ```Add value``` to add an entity value to the list below.

![Entity screen with values per the lab.][entityValues]

Are there any other toppings you might want on your pizza? What is your favorite? Add it to the list!

You have now created an entity! Let's pull our intent and entity together with dialog.

## Build Dialog

Working with our intent and entity, we can start diagramming out our dialog. 

Click ```Dialog```.

![My entities screen with one entity with an annotation pointing to Dialog tab.][dialog]

If a dialog tree has already been started, we would see it below. Let's create one.

Click ```Create```. (Additionally you can click 'x' if the chat popups in the right hand corner like you see in the screenshot)

![Initial dialog screen with an annotation pointing to the create button.][createDialog]

Notice there are two nodes created automatically. When adding new nodes, remember to put them between the "Welcome" node and the "Anything else" node. Nodes that are listed after the "Anything else" node will not be evaluated.

Click ```Add node```. This will add a node between the two existing nodes.

![Dialog screen with 2 initial nodes and an annotation pointing to Add node.][addNode]

Your node has been placed in the dialog tree and is ready to be constructed.

![New node in dialog tree with information form open.][newNode]

Let's start by adding our intent to the ```If assistant recognizes: ``` field. Click the field and notice you can filter by # or intents. Find the ```#order``` intent you created in an earlier step.

In the dialog tree you can see the intent name is listed in the node. Feel free to name the node as well.

![New node with intent added for Watson to recognize.][dialogAddIntent]

If you name the node, you will see both the name and what the assistant recognizes in the top level information of the node.

![New node adding text response per lab.][dialogAddText]

Let's add some response text and test it out in the console. Type a response like ```I can help you order a pizza, but I need some more information``` so your user knows that Watson understands the #order intent. 

Click the ```Try It``` button in the upper left corner to open up the ```Try it out``` panel.

Type in one of your user examples in your intent like ```I need help```. Does Watson respond?

![Dialog screen showing dialog node tree and node with try it out panel opened for testing Watson.][dialogTryText]

Let's make this a little more useful. Hit "Customize" to the right of the order name field. A modal will appear.

We are going to be using slots, so turn on the toggle and check the ```Prompt for everything``` box.

Hit ```Apply```.

![Model of Customizing Create Ticket node with slots enabled and prompt for everything checked.][dialogCustomizeSlot]

Your node has changed. ```Then check for:``` provides a new set of fields. 

In the ```Check for``` column find your ```@toppings``` entity. The context variable (denoted by the $) will autopopulate, keep it. 

In the ```If not present, ask``` column type ```What kind of ticket would you like to submit?```

This allows us to look for the information if its already provided, or ask for it since we will need it to complete this intent.

![Node with slots enabled and first slot information filled in per lab.][dialogSlot]

Let's test it! You might want to hit ```Clear``` in the ```Try it out``` panel. 

![Try it out panel open to test Watson with node and slot functionality.][dialogSlotTest] 

Watson should have correctly identified the intent, and prompted you with the slot question. If you answer with one of the entity values, you should see it in bold, followed by the response. 


## Congratulations!
